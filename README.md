# Overview

This project is meant to use image recognition to identify shoe models and then proceed to narrow it down to the specific sku of the shoe.
This project is being built for Notify, which they intend to incorporate into their monitors and ping for profitable skus.
This could prove helpful in the future if stores ever start messing with the titles but still uploading correct images of the product.
One store that currently does this is TheBetterGeneration. Using this method could make a TheBetterGeneration bot that only runs for profitable skus.
